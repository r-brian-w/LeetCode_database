# Solution from LeetCode
MySQL

SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;

Approach: Using IFNULL and LIMIT clause [Accepted]
Another way to solve the 'NULL' problem is to use IFNULL function as below.

MySQL

SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
