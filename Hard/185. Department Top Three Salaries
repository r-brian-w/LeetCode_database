# Write your MySQL query statement below
with cte as (select e.id as id
                    , e.name as name

select department as Department
        , name as Employee
        , salary as Salary
from cte
where ranking < 4 # CAN CHANGE IT TO <=3

# THINK LIKE THIS BUT DONT KNOW HOW TO WRITE IT, SO I WRITE USING CTE 
# THANKS lianj FOR CODE

select b.Name as Department, a.Name as Employee, Salary
from
(select *, dense_rank() over(partition by DepartmentId order by Salary DESC) as ranks
from Employee) a
join Department b
on a.DepartmentId = b.Id
where ranks <= 3

# MORE SIMPLE SOLUTION
# THANKS baiji FOR CODE

select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
where 3 > (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  );
