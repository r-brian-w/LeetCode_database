# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 or referee_id is null

#Official Solution
#MySQL
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
#or
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

#Other Solution
#Thanks flgqz0305
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE IFNULL(referee_id, 0) <> 2

#Thanks ye15
SELECT name 
FROM Customer
WHERE COALESCE(referee_id, 0) != 2;

# IFNULL and COALESCE HAVE SAME FUNCTION 
# TO REPLACE NULL VALUE WITH SOMETHING
